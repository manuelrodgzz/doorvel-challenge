# Doorvel Challenge
For this project I decided to learn and use the new app router and server components from Next JS v13.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install

# or

yarn install
```
2. Run the development server:

  

```bash

npm run  dev

# or

yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
